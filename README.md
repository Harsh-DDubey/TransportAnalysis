# Transport Analysis Project (Class 12th)

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive **Transport Analysis System** developed using **Python**. It leverages various libraries to analyze transportation data, calculate distances, and provide useful insights for transport management.

ðŸš¨ **Heads Up!** ðŸš¨
> This project is an **unfinished prototype**, a work-in-progress that never quite made it to the finish line.If you're diving into this, expect some **rough edges, missing pieces, and bugs** lurking around. Feel free to **tweak, fix, and improve** it as you see fitâ€”because, well, it's not of much use to me anymore! 

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** using Tkinter
- **Database Integration** with MySQL using pymysql
- **Text-to-Speech Support** using pyttsx3
- **Image Handling** using Pillow (PIL)
- **Geolocation and Distance Calculation** using geopy

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: tkinter, pymysql, pyttsx3, Pillow, geopy

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites
- Install Python (Recommended: Python 3.8 or higher)
- Install MySQL database server
